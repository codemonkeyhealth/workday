# Work Day
Incorporates healthy habits that become as natural as breathing.

There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:
•	Decide on the wellness habit to complete
•	Set your timer 60 minutes (if you have acute condition or are highly motivated set for 25) 
•	When the timer goes off take 30 to 120 seconds to complete the wellness task
•	Reset timer and repeat
•	Every second 60 minute session (or fourth 25 minute session) take a 15 – 30 minute wellness break. This is the perfect time to eat a full meal and do something you enjoy. Just be sure to take the 30 to 120 seconds upfront for your wellness habit.
Best practice: Consume plant based fat every 3 to 4 hours, complete a full body movement every 3 to 4 hours, stretch and engage your “sitting muscles” every 3 to 4 hours, stretch and engage your hands and arms every 3 to 4 hours, stretch and engage neck every 3 to 4 hours, stretch and engage shoulders every 3 to 4 hour, complete a partial or complete body movement every hour, elevate your heart rate every 2 to 3 hours.  Following this standard will reduce pain, stiffness and fatigue; help improve energy, lower stress and anxiety, maintain healthy blood pressure and weight, elevate your mood, and keeps the heart healthy. Further, regular exercise stimulates the memory function region of the brain to release chemical (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) which rewires your memory circuits making them work better. 
Beginners: Begin by running a Plant Based Fat every 3 to 4 hours. After successful integration add Full Body Movement every 3 to 4 hours.  Then continue adding packages as you prefer until all packages are fully integrated.
